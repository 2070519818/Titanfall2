## How to ask help

The NoSkill discord is **not a support discord for modding** or for the ones **who don't read given information**. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is a good example how to **not** ask help:

> JustaNub: Hey  
> JustaNub: I don't find R97 crosshair

**Just no.. Spend 5 more minutes reading, you will find what you are looking for.**
