# 2. How to backup, extract & repack

## How to backup & extract VPK's properly ?

When you are about to extract VPK files, you need a directory where files will be extracted from the selected VPK. This folder **should not** be inside your game directory. I would recommend you to create a folder with an easy name like `Titanfall 2 modding` in this path:

```text
C:\Users\YourSessionName\Documents
>Result
C:\Users\YourSessionName\Documents\Titanfall 2 modding
```

Once you have created this folder I would recommend to create a subfolder called `backup` dedicated for, guess what.. backups. \(Yey!\)

```text
C:\Users\YourSessionName\Documents\Titanfall 2 Modding\backup
```
