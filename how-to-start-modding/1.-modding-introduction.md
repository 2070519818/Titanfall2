description: A first step to learn Titanfall 2 modding properly

# 1. Modding introduction

## First step

Before getting into Titanfall 2 modding, you should backup any VPK files that you will get into, if you mess up or your VPK files get corrupted you don't need to download or repair your game from Origin because you will learn how to make a backup !  
In this guide, the location of each VPK file will be listed at the beginning of the page.  
  
This Gitbook repo will be updated over time as I get new information about what's possible around Titanfall 2 modding. You can check the [NoSkill Community Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/sEgmTKg) where I leave update notifications each time content will be added here.  
  
Feel free to ask help / information around. Just make sure to ask in the Titanfall section !  
  
The Discord server **is not a support server for vpk modding** for the one **who don't read given information**.  
This is a good example how to **not** ask help

```text
JustaNub: Hey
JustaNub: I don't find R97 crosshair
```

Just no.. Spend 5 more minutes reading you will find what you are looking for.

## First step & 1/2

As a side note, in this wiki I will refer to some tools to do certain process. Check out "[Modding tools](https://wanty5883.gitbook.io/titanfall2/information/modding-tools)" page. In the different guide I link this page when I talk about tools anyway.

  
It's now time to move on second part ! Just follow the numbers in " How to start modding ?" category.
