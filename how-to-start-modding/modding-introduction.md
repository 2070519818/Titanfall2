# Modding introduction

## First step

Before getting into Titanfall 2 modding, you should backup any VPK files that you will get into, if you mess up or your VPK files get corrupted you don't need to download or repair your game from Origin because you will learn how to make a backup

{% hint style="info" %}
In this guide, the location of each VPK file will be listed at the beginning of the page.
{% endhint %}

This Gitbook repo will be updated over time as I get new information about what's possible around Titanfall 2 modding. You can check the [NoSkill Community Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/sEgmTKg) where I leave update notifications each time content will be added here.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Discord server **is not a support server for vpk modding**.
{% endhint %}

## Notes

As a side note, in this wiki I will refer to some tools to do certain processes. Check out "[Modding tools](https://wanty5883.gitbook.io/titanfall2/information/modding-tools)" page. In the different guide I link this page when I talk about tools anyway.
