# Albedo

An albedo \(sometimes diffuse map\) is a [texture ](../)containing view-independent color information. It is what we normally think of a texture as being, as opposed to 'treatment' textures like bump maps or specular masks.

Albedos are referenced in [materials ](../valve-material-type-vmt/)with the [`$basetexture`](../valve-material-type-vmt/usdbasetexture.md) command.
